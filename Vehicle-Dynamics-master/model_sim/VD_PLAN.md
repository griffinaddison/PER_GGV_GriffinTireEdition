1) Vectornav
2) Tire temp -> kinematics of suspension
3) imu -> Control body SA / yaw rate control / tire slip angle control
4) Pushrod loads

High-level rev6
Accumulator: Let's look at testing data from lap time vs energy
Tire load: single corner spring damper, damper settings front / rear, roll center
Point mass stuff: compare full dynamic one to actual response
Yaw rate response

springs & dampers: 2 competing factors: sprung mass motion, want fast sprung mass transients. Contact patch normal force variation to be low. Combine load cell and vectornav data. High pass filter tire load data
